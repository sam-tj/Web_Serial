# Web Serial

Tired of uploading website data to ESP32 everytime there is a small change on webpage or justs a CSS fix? Maybe forgot to add function to JS file??

This method allows hosting website on a local server or a cloud server like Github. The website connects to the local device via local IP address and allows data transmission through it.

### About

This is an example project which allows to send data from server hosted websites (like Github) to Local network devices.
The code can be modified according to application. It can also be implemented to get data from devices and publish it to server hosted websites.
